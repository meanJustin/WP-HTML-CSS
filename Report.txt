The project would be divided into 4 steps.

First build the boilerplate for your project
And convert all html files to html

It costs more than 200


And second using  your previous database set the new database.
Costs would be 100

And develop the backend apis
200

And fourth step is testing and debuging
From there 100

It's the minimun costs of this project.

But I think we could make agreement on 400
Hope to discuss about that on $Kyp_  : MeanJustin623
